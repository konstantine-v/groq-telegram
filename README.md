## Groq-Telegram

A template for chatting with Groq models in Telegram.

## Prerequisites

- Groq API key via the [developer panel](https://console.groq.com/keys).
- Create a bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

## Roadmap
TBD

## Prerequisites

- I prefer [bun]() to npm, but the commands are the same for npm/yarn/pnpm etc. But make sure that's installed.


## Dev / Testing

_Note: Make sure to setup your bot via BotFather and start a chat with it_

Start the bot script:
`bun run dev`

Start typing to your bot.

I/O should be printed in the console so you can see.

## Deploy

`bun run start`
