## Groq-Telegram

A template for chatting with Groq models in Telegram using TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- Create a bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).

## Roadmap

## Prerequisites

This project is primarily designed to be used with [bun](https://bun.sh). The commands shown use bun, but you can adapt them for npm, yarn, or pnpm if preferred. Be sure to have bun installed before proceeding.


## Dev / Testing

_Note: Make sure to setup your bot via BotFather and start a chat with it_

Start the bot script:
`bun run dev`

Start typing to your bot.

I/O should be printed in the console so you can see.
